# Blackhole Simulation – Quantum Fluctuations

This project simulates quantum effects near blackhole event horizons in real time.  
It demonstrates computational modeling, predictions of quantum fluctuations, and visualization.  

Built using Python [or your language/framework] and incorporates advanced simulation algorithms.  

This is my core project showcasing research, coding, and physics skills.  
Additional files, code, and results will be added shortly.
